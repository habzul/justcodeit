Iâ€™m passionate about backend development, building scalable and efficient applications, and continuously expanding my knowledge of modern technologies.

With hands-on experience in .NET development, RESTful APIs, and database management, Iâ€™m eager to take on new challenges and grow as part of a collaborative team.

If you have advice, open roles, or project recommendations, Iâ€™d love to connect!

Looking forward to joining a team where I can contribute meaningfully and grow along the way. Letâ€™s build something great together! ðŸš€
